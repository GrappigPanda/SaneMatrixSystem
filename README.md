# SaneMatrixSystem
A simple matrix system designed to support simple arithmetic better than Boost. 

I designed this with the intentions of having a higher performance and less generic 
matrix system than what Boost's uBLAS had to offer. As it stands, the class
fulfills the needs of my Neural neural network project
(https://github.com/GrappigPanda/NeuralNetworkCPP) and this was the main target of
this repository in the first place.

TODO:

Better manage file structure
Add unit tests (probably using Google's testing framework)
